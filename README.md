This program is developed based on the toolbox Parallel Hierarchical Grid (PHG), whch is currently under active development at State Key Laboratory 
of Scientific and Engineering Computing of Chinese Academy of Sciences. This program solve the three-dimensional Drift-Diffusion (DD) model used in semiconductor device
simulations with the finite element methods (FEMs). In this program, we implement two kinds of non-standard FEMs, one is proposed by Zlamal and the other is porposed by 
us. We are inspired by the famous inverse averaging techniques and design our method. Our numerical experiments with realistic three-dimensional semiconductor devices show 
that our methods can produce physical numerical solutions to the DD model, and it performs better than Zlamal's method at higher biases.
